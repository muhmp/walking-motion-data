# Collecting motion data with motion transition implementation

## Introduction

In order to produce motion data, motion
capture system used as a tool to produce motion
data by performing the movement on motion
capture system. The purpose of this research
project is to collect motion data that can be used
in locomotion synthesis with motion transition
and to show the visualization results from the
motion transition to obtain the movement from
current movement to the next movement.
Our method us Motion transitions method to
combine motions sequences to get a new
sequences of motions. In order to collect motion
data of a humanoid character, we first capture
motions of a human subject by acting in a various
ways such as walking, stepping, turning, and
other ways of movements in various orientations
in motion capture system then we process the
motion data in Visual Studio to be used in motion
transition implementation.


## Motion Capture
Motion capture are popular for creating digital
human animation. By using motion capture, user
can control body movements while producing
movement. Markers or sensors are attached to
user and connected to the optical camera.
We used Optitrack system as a motion capture
provider to make a 3D model human interactive
movement. In the process of recording motion, we
measure orientation, ground plane, number of
steps, and type of movement.
